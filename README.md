#:heart_eyes_cat: Kinder :heart_eyes_cat:

Kinder is a parody of a popular social matching application. Once logged in, the user is presented with an image of a kitten provided by the PlaceKittens API.  Below the image, the user can select from two icons to decide whether they think the kitten is "meow" or "not meow".  

This application was built using Sinatra, ActiveRecord and Postgresql for database functions, and Bcrypt for authentication.  Bootstrap was utilized as the styling framework.

Version 2 will contain enhancements to show previous selections as well as responsive mobile capabilities allowing the user to swipe left or right for ease of decision making.
